# Iris Tracking Model
Real-time iris detection refers to the process of identifying and locating irises within live or recorded video streams in real-time.
This technology involves detecting the presence of eyes, extracting iris regions, and potentially recognizing individuals based on their iris patterns, all in a continuous and immediate manner.
## Background
1. Iris detection involves identifying and localizing the iris region within an eye image or video frame. It utilizes computer vision techniques to detect distinct features and patterns unique to the iris.
2. Typically, iris detection involves preprocessing steps like image segmentation and feature extraction, followed by classification or recognition algorithms.
3. It finds applications in biometric identification systems, authentication, and medical diagnostics, leveraging the iris's uniqueness for accurate identification and analysis.
